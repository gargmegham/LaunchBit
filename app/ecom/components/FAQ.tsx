            <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
                eCommerce stands for Electronic Commerce. It refers to the buying and selling of goods or services using
                the internet, and the transfer of money and data to execute these transactions. eCommerce websites are
                online portals that facilitate online transactions of goods and services through means of the transfer
                of information and funds over the Internet.

            <p>
                The cost of an eCommerce website can vary widely depending on several factors such as the complexity of
                the design, the number of products you plan to sell, the functionality required (like payment gateways,
                shipping integration), and any custom features or integrations. Prices can range from a few thousand
                dollars for a basic setup to tens of thousands for a custom, large-scale eCommerce site. We provide a
                detailed quote after understanding your specific needs to ensure transparency and accuracy in pricing.
