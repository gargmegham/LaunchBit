            <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
                SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of
                traffic to your website through organic search engine results. This involves optimizing your
                website&apos;s content, structure, and on-site elements to make it more attractive to search engines
                like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. SEO strategies include keyword research, content creation, link building,
                and technical improvements to enhance your site&apos;s visibility in search engine results pages
                (SERPs).

            <p>
                SEO is crucial because it makes your website more visible, which means more traffic and the opportunity
                to convert prospects into customers. It is a fundamental part of digital marketing because people
                conduct trillions of searches every year, often with commercial intent to find information about
                products and services. Being visible as a trusted resource by Google and other search engines is always
                going to work in a brand&apos;s favor. Quality SEO and a high-quality website take brands there.

                The cost of SEO services can vary widely depending on the scope of the project, the specific goals of
                your business and the competitiveness of your industry. We provide customized quotes after understanding

                Yes, our goal is to improve your website&apos;s ranking in Google by implementing effective SEO
                strategies tailored to your business. While we cannot guarantee specific rankings (as Google&apos;s

        question: "How long does it take to see results from SEO?",
        answer: (
            <div className="space-y-2 leading-relaxed">
                Seeing significant results from SEO can vary, typically taking anywhere from 3 to 6 months or more. SEO
                is a long-term strategy because it involves building a solid foundation and accumulating authoritative
                backlinks, which don&apos;t happen overnight. The timeframe can also depend on the competitiveness of
                your industry and the current state of your website. However, once momentum is gained, SEO efforts often
                lead to sustained traffic growth and improved rankings over time.
