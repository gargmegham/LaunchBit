                The timeline for building a website can vary based on its complexity, the number of pages, and specific

                complex projects can take 12 weeks or longer. We establish a project timeline at the beginning of our
                engagement, including key milestones and deadlines, to ensure a clear understanding of the process and
                keep the project on track.
