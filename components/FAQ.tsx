            <p>
                Our design process begins with a consultation to understand your vision, goals, and requirements. We
                then move on to creating a design proposal, which includes wireframes and mockups. Once approved, we
                develop the site, conduct thorough testing for usability and compatibility, and finally, launch the
                site. We ensure continuous communication throughout the process to keep you updated and involved.

                The timeline for building a website varies depending on its complexity, the number of pages, and

                finish, while more complex projects may take 12 weeks or longer. We provide a project timeline before
                starting any work to set clear expectations.
